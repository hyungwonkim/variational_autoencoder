# variational_autoencoder
This is an introduction to variational autoencoder with some mathematical derivations and application to MNIST dataset. 
For presentation slides, I combined (with minor modifications) the materials from https://www.jeremyjordan.me/variational-autoencoders/ and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaaqyVS9-rM and arxiv.1606.05908v2. 
For jupyter notebook, I borrowed source codes from https://github.com/FelixMohr/Deep-learning-with-Python/blob/master/VAE.ipynb for setup and https://jmetzen.github.io/2015-11-27/vae.html for plotting. I modified the method of creation of tensorflow graph architecture for my ease of understanding (not meant to be more efficient).
